* Future Features

** Specify halt on error/failure 
   Let users specify by their choosen test execution context
     if errors should be recorded or automatically fail into
     the debugger

** Print Methods on test runner
   Now has bare print commands that can't be overridden
   Should delegate to a method which can be patched

** Timing
   Add calculation and printing of the time it to complete
     unit test execution

** Specified test discovery
   Execute a test fixture specified by some string 
     identifier, probably just the fixture name 
   Also needs a convience method for use to call
     with the test name
 
** Test loader Discover / Load Files 
   Must be able to handle loading scripts not in 
     the 'pkg:/source' directory as these will not
     be in the global name space by default

** Asserts

*** Add new asserts
   assertIn(item, iterable) - specified item is found in the enumerable object
   assertCausesError(callable, error_code) - calling specified method results in the specified error number

*** Upgrade existing asserts
   Add support for 'types' in assertEqual and assertNotEqual (list, array, hash)
